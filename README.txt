The Light Mod
--------------
Currently version 1.0, beta. Running Minecraft v1.7.2.

This mod was made for a fake religion created by Florida-based server host, LuxLegatus.
His in-game religion, The Lord of Light, warranted some special items made from a lighter
material, namely quartz. All hail the Lord of Light!


Lord of Light Items
====================
So far, the implemented list of items includes:
	- Full set of Quartz armor and appropriate recipes


Installation
=============
This mod runs with the help of Minecraft Forge available for download here:

This mod currently runs version 1.7.2.


Acknowledgements
=======================
Made by chicklightning (gavrile in Minecraft).

Thanks to LuxLegatus for the creative inspiration.

Thanks to Minecraft Forge, since this project would not have been possible without it.

Thanks to everyone who currently is or ever has played on my server, since you all made
Minecraft fun and compelled me to get a job where I could actually teach modding for a
living. I would never have gotten the help and materials I needed otherwise, and just
knowing that you guys will potentially see and use this mod makes it worth creating. Hope
you all have fun!
