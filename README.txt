The Light Mod
--------------
Currently version 0.5.2, beta. Running Minecraft v1.7.2.

This mod was made for a fake religion created by Florida-based server host, LuxLegatus. His in-game religion, The Lord of Light, warranted some special items made from a lighter material, namely quartz. All hail the Lord of Light!


Lord of Light Items
====================
So far, the implemented list of items includes:
	- Full set of Quartz armor and appropriate recipes
	- Obsidian sword with appropriate recipe
	- Quartz sword with approriate recipe
	- Blessed Quartz Sword
	- Cursed Obsidian Sword
	- Lesser blessings and curses - temporary self-buffs
	- Greater blessings and curses - permanent enchants
	- Lord of Light Altar

Changelog
=========
v0.5.2 Added recipe to create Altar block.
v0.5.1 Minor Altar Block bug fixing; right-clicking the Altar now correctly grants both Lesser Blessing buffs and has small chance of dropping a Greater Blessing | Altar is also unbreakable.
v0.5.0 Added an Altar block, which has a chance of granting a random Lesser Blessing buff on right-clicking; unfortunately the texture for the top of the block doesn't render properly.
v0.4.2 Changed Quartz Armor/Sword enchantments to be on-par with Diamond enchantments for Greater Blessings and Curses.
v0.4.1 Added recipes so Quartz Swords and Quartz Armor can benefit from Greater Blessing/Curse enchants | Changed many of the existing recipes so that they are on a sliding scale; iron benefits the least, then diamond, then quartz items.
v0.4.0 Added a Blessed Quartz Sword and Cursed Obsidian Sword, now differentiated from Quartz and Obsidian Swords, which have normal sword recipes | Blessed and Cursed swords now have the recipes the previous regular Quartz and Obsidian swords had (using Greater Blessings and Curses) | Blessed and Cursed Swords now have special damage effects.
v0.3.2 Greater Blessing/Curse recipes now create two of each Blessing/Curse.
v0.3.1 Added recipes to create Greater Blessings and Curses.
v0.3.0 Added Greater Blessings/Curses that can be combined with vanilla items to give them enchantments | Added recipes to create Obsidian and Quartz swords, which have Greater Blessing/Curse components.
v0.2.1 Altered Obsidian Sword to have a random enchantment upon crafting, and dismounts opponent | Quartz sword now blinds opponents and requires a Nether Star to repair it.
v0.2.0 Added Lesser Blessings, altered Obsidian Sword and added basics for Quartz Sword.
v0.1.0 Added an Obsidian Sword.
v0.0.1 Slightly modified the durability of quartz armor.
v0.0.0 First commit; quartz armor and recipes added.


Installation
=============
This mod runs with the help of Minecraft Forge available for download here:

——— http://files.minecraftforge.net/ ———

Download the Minecraft Forge 1.7.2 Installer. Open up the .rar file using something like WinRAR (for Macs, UnrarX works great). Go to Minecraft, and first, click “Edit Profile” and select that you want to run Minecraft version 1.7.2. Hit Play so that the necessary files are generated.

Forge will then allow you to install it by just running the .jar file you downloaded. Select the “Client” version. Open Minecraft again and select that you want to run the “Forge” profile instead of your normal profile. After Forge is done running and setting up your new Minecraft environment, drag and drop this mod into the “mods” folder that is generated in your .minecraft folder (or for Macs, under Library/Application Support/Minecraft). The mod should now be playable!


Acknowledgements
=======================
Made by chicklightning (gavrile in Minecraft).

Thanks to LuxLegatus for the creative inspiration.

Thanks to Minecraft Forge, since this project would not have been possible without it.

Thanks to everyone who currently is or ever has played on my server, since you all made Minecraft fun and compelled me to get a job where I could actually teach modding for a living. I would never have gotten the help and materials I needed otherwise, and just knowing that you guys will potentially see and use this mod makes it worth creating. Hope you all have fun!
